# (My) ESLint Configuration

Javascript is super flexible, theres tons of ways of writting the exact same code, because of that it takes more mental process to understand every person code styling.

Having functions like `function add (a, b) {return a + b;}` or should we have `const add = (a, b) => a + b`, or both ðŸ˜±? Concating with `+` or string template literals?

These and too many other details take energy and focus from me that I could put into understanding what the code is actually doing.

With that in mind, this configuration aims to have almost no decision in this kind of things including **code standards**.
